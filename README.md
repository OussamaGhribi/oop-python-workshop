# oop-workshop
 This repository contains a Python workshop project that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in the context of a banking application. Key features include:

## Encapsulation: Properties are managed with getters and setters for controlled access.
- **Inheritance**: Classes extend functionality from base classes to create specialized objects.
- **Abstraction**: Complex operations are hidden behind methods, offering a simplified interface.
- **Database Integration**: Interacts with a PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving client data.
### The project includes multiple classes (Client, ClientOut, ClientReport) showcasing various OOP principles and practical applications in a banking system.
